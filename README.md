# CranPiTFT
Useful lib for using the Adafruit Raspberry Pi TFT LCD display.

This is an object-oriented wrapper (such as it is) around various bits of code to make
it easier to use the (Adafruit 1.3" TFT LCD display)[https://www.adafruit.com/product/4484] for the Raspberry Pi, in Python3.

For now, it only supports the 1.3" display, st7789, 240x240 (but it should be pretty easy
  to modify it for the other similar Adafruit displays).

For much info on this cool little part, see (Adafruit)[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-pitft-135x240-color-tft-add-on-for-raspberry-pi].
